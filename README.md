# MLOps-Rust
exploration of Rust as an MLOps language

## Key Terms
- <b>Rust</b> - A modern systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and efficiency. Offers advanced features like guaranteed memory safety.

- <b>rustup</b> - The toolchain installer for Rust. Allows easy installation of the compiler, package manager cargo, and other Rust tools.

- <b>Cargo</b> - The Rust build system and package manager. Used to manage dependencies and build/compile Rust projects.

- <b>Crates</b> - Packages of Rust code that can be shared on crates.io. Equivalent to libraries or modules in other languages.

- <b>rustfmt</b> - The Rust formatter tool, used to automatically format Rust source code based on guidelines. Enforces consistent style.

- <b>Clippy</b> - A Rust linter tool that analyzes code and detects potential issues or improvements. Helps write more idiomatic Rust.

- <b>Makefile</b> - File that defines rules/commands to automate building and managing a project. Allows standardization of workflows.

- <b>Codespaces</b> - Browser-based development environments hosted by GitHub. Come preconfigured for productivity with Rust.

- <b>GitHub Copilot</b> - AI pair programmer tool designed to suggest code completions and entire functions in real time. Supports Rust.

## Swithcing from python to RUST
- resent language
    - included best practices of other languages
    - packaging -> cargo based system
- performance -> C/C++ level performance
- concurrency -> python; global interpreter lock
- Safety: desinged as a system programming language, considered safety
- compiled languge -> binary executable
- Code assist -> GitHub copiolot
